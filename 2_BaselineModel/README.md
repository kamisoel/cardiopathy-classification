# Baseline Model

**[Notebook](baseline_model.ipynb)**

A feature based approach using anatomical & physiological features 
typically employed in this domain, e.g. ventricle volumes and myocardium thickness.
A simple sklearn pipeline is implemented to test different ML models and hyperparameters
using the engineered features.
